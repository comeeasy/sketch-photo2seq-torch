# sketch-photo2seq-torch

## Introduction
> Human doesn't see world as grids of pixels.<br>
> Therefore, several methods to generate **vector** images are propoesed.<br> The seminal work, [Ha et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477) a.k.a  `sketch-rnn` was proposed in 2017.<br>
> As a follow-up study, [Song et al. In CVPR. 2019](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Song_Learning_to_Sketch_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) a.k.a `sketch-photo2seq` was proposed to solve weak supervision problem and the [code](https://github.com/MarkMoHR/sketch-photo2seq) was provided.<br> 
> Unfortunately, The code was written in tensorflow v1.<br>
> To enjoy advances of newest version of pytorch, I produce a duplication of [sketch-photo2seq](https://github.com/MarkMoHR/sketch-photo2seq).

## Environments
```python
torch==1.10.1
torchvision==0.11.2
numpy==1.22.3
matplotlib
PIL
svgwrite
```
###### Few packages are used. Just install.

## Datasets
> We need **two** datasets. 
> 1. QuickDraw
>  
>   - Download the `Numpy .npz files` from this [link](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset#sketch-rnn-quickdraw-dataset) and place the file into `datasets/QuickDraw/shoes/npz`
> 2. QMUL-Shoes
>   - Download the `train_svg_spa_png.h5`, `test_svg_spa_png.h5` files into `datasets/QMUL/shoes`.
>   - Download the `Fine-Grained SBIR Datasets` (shoes and chairs)
>   - Unzip the `ShoeV2` that is contained in `Fine_Grained SBIR Datasets`
>   - Move the all "REAL IMAGES" not "sketches" into `datasets/QMUL/shoes/photos` 

## ðŸš€Training
> 1. Write a config file. (Follow the `configs/defualt_config.yml`) and place the file into `configs`
> 2. run the below code.<br>
>   `python train.py --config="configs/your-config.yml"` <br>
>   - e.g.
>       `python train.py --config="configs/default_config.yml"`

## ðŸ–Œ Sampling
> - You can follow `sample.ipynb`

## Thanks to
> `sketch-photo2seq` directely borrows `sketch-rnn`'s encoder and decoder.<br> Therefore I needed pytorch version of `sketch-rnn. and directly borrow below repo.

> To build encoder and decoder for raster images, I directely borrowed below repo.
